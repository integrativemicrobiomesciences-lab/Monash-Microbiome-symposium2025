High blood pressure (BP) affects 1 in 3 adults and despite the availability of many treatment options, >50% of those on medication do not have their BP under control. Uncontrolled BP leads to significant morbidity including heart attacks, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. My research has advanced knowledge into new mechanisms and therapeutic targets that address this unmet clinical need. Specifically, my research focuses on leveraging the gut microbiota and host signalling of gut microbiota-derived metabolites to develop innovative treatments for hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.


MY CONTRIBUTION
 
I am only 1.5 years post-PhD. Overall recognition of this program includes:
- In the past 3 years, I have an FWCI of 2.19 (i.e., my publications have been cited 119% more than the global average for my field), in the top 99th percentile by worldwide topic prominence in gut microbiota (T.8040, SciVal, FWCI 2.86).
- I have published 19 papers including 10 original research articles, 4 invited reviews, 2 editorials, and 3 preprints. I already have >600 citations with 5 papers with >50 citations and an h-index 9 (Google Scholar, 24/3/25). I have published in several leading cardiovascular journals, including European Heart Journal (2/220 cardiac), Circulation Research (5/196 physiology), Cardiovascular Research (11/222 cardiac), and Hypertension (top clinical hypertension).
- Travel awards ($25,000 total) from EMBL, Foundation for High Blood Pressure Research, International Society of Hypertension, and Hypertension Australia.
- Awards: won 12 and was a finalist for 17.
- Presentations: Invited talks from the Victorian Heart Institute, Hypertension Australia, Lembo/Carnevale laboratory. 
- Added Altmetric score of 610 (>60% from overseas), including >20 mentions in news and blogs, and 4 Wikipedia mentions.
 
RESEARCH PROGRAMâ€™S CONTRIBUTION
- I am the first author of 8 papers (42%) and have led the research leading to the claims below, including supervision of 1 undergraduate student and 2 honours students (all H1) within the program.
-  Funding ($328,000 total): I have secured competitive funding from the Heart Foundation (Vanguard grant 2025-2026, $150,000) and Australian Stroke and Heart Research Accelerator (2024-2025, $158,000) as a CI, and the Foundation of High Blood Pressure Research Australia ($20,000) as CIA.
