biosketch
My reseasrch focuses on leveraging the gut microbiota and host signalling of gut microbiota-derived metabolites to develop innovative treatments for hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. I am 1.5 years post-PhD and ranked among the top 5 most published Australian researchers in gut microbiota (T.8040, SciVal), all in cardiovascular research. I have secured $328K in competitive funding as a CI from the Heart Foundation ($150,000) and the Australian Stroke and Heart Research Accelerator ($158,000), along with sole CI grant from the Foundation of High Blood Pressure Research ($20,000). I have published 19 papers (80% in top 10% journals), including 8 first-author publications (42%), with >500 citations (5 publications with >50 citations), h-index 9 (Google Scholar, 28/3/2025), FWCI 2.6. My work has appeared in top journals like European Heart Journal, Circulation Research, Cardiovascular Research, and Hypertension, with one paper featured on a journal cover and achieving top 5% attention scores. I have led initiatives nationally and internationally, holding roles such as postdoctoral representative (local), Victorian Cardiovascular Research Network Rising Stars Sub-Committee (state), chair of the Hypertension Australia Early Career Researchers Committee (national), and member of the ISH New Investigator Committee (international). I have been a finalist for 17 awards, winning 12 (total value ~ $25k). Notable recognitions include the Ralph Reader Prize (Cardia Society of Australia and New Zealand) and the ISH New Investigator Award.
