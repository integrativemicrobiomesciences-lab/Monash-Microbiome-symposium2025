Andre Mu is a Senior Lecturer and Laboratory Head with the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Monash University, and is affiliated with the Biomedicine Discovery Institute’s Infection, and Metabolism, diabetes & obesity Programs.

Andre has over 14 years of training across five world-leading institutions spanning three continents, each position supported by prestigious individual research fellowships, totalling >$411,000, including:

Endeavour Research Fellowship: Doherty Institute & UCSD (Australia & USA)
EMBL-EBI & Sanger Research Fellowship: Wellcome Sanger Institute & EMBL-EBI (UK)
NOMIS Foundation Research Fellowship: Salk Institute for Biological Studies (USA)

Andre has trained with world-leaders in microbiology, microbiome sciences, and host-pathogen interactions, including:

Prof. Janelle S. Ayres (Host metabolism and pathogen interactions; Salk),<br/>
Prof. Rob Knight (Integrative microbiome sciences; UCSD),<br/>
Dr. Trevor D. Lawley (Bacteriophage genomics in early life microbiome sciences; Sanger),<br/>
Prof. Timothy P. Stinear (Pathogen genomics; UniMelb), and<br/>
Prof. Richard A. Strugnell (Molecular microbiology; UniMelb).<br/>

His graduate research at the University of Melbourne with Assoc. Prof., John Moreau (UGlasgow) was in environmental sciences (microbial ecology and bioinformatics) elucidating the interactions of a 1.5-km deep subsurface microbial community using high-throughput sequencing technologies. During this time, Andre was awarded a competitive fellowship through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to train in anaerobic microbiology with Prof., Gerrit Voourdouw at the University of Calgary.

Andre has authored 30 publications to date in journals such as Nature Communications, Nature Reviews Microbiology, and Microbiome – all with the common themes of microbiome sciences at the leading-edge of integrating techniques from different disciplines and omic platforms, defining future directions of research.
