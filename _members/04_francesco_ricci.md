I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne where I studied population structure and ecophysiology of microbes living in symbiosis with tropical Scleractinian corals. Following my PhD, I developed an interest in understanding how life adapts to extreme environments such as the deep sea and hypersaline lakes. I joined the Greening Lab in 2023, where I investigate chemosynthesis in aquatic systems including deep sea corals, Antarctica, underwater wrecks and aquatic caves.
