Professor Chris Greening leads the One Health Microbiology group at Monash University's Biomedicine Discovery Institute. Following a first-class degree in Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at the University of Oxford (2010), he undertook a doctorate at the University of Otago (2013) investigating the physiological roles of the hydrogenases in mycobacteria. He then gained postdoctoral and lecturing experience at the University of Otago, CSIRO, and Australian National University. 

In 2016, he was appointed as a group leader in Monash University's School of Biological Sciences and completed an environmentally-focused ARC DECRA Fellowship. In 2020, he moved to Monash's Department of Microbiology to take up a medically-focused NHMRC EL2 Fellowship. Trained in the fields of biochemistry and microbiology, Chris also has experience in genetics, microbial ecology, and molecular evolution, and thrives working across disciplines. 

He is a CI on four major projects:
- RISE: Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments
- Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases
- SAEF: Securing Antartica's Environmental Future
- ARC Research Hub for Carbon Utilisation and Recycling
In 2020, Chris joined the Monash Centre to Impact AMR as a founding member and chair of the environmental engineering strategy group, and is currently developing and leading the Centre's AMR R&D Facility. In 2022, he was awarded the Fenner Medal from he Australian Academy of Science.
