Her research focuses on microbial symbioses, coral adaptation, and reef restoration, with innovations in bioengineering technqiues that accelerate coral acclimatisation and adaptation. Van Oppen's work has been pivotal in shaping global coral conservation efforts and is widely used by research institutions worldwide. Her research has led to over 290 peer-reviewed articles, books and book chpaters."%}
