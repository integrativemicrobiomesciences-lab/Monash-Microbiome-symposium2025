# Microbiome Sciences at Monash University

We are excited to announce a one-day symposium dedicated to microbiome sciences, designed to bring together researchers from across Monash University who share an interest in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. 

This event will take place on **7th November 2025** at the Learning Village, Clayton campus, and the organising committee warmly welcomes colleagues from all disciplines to join us. The program features a fantastic line-up of speakers who will showcase world-leading research spanning diverse ecosystems - from host-associated microbiomes to those shaping the environmnet - highlighting the breadth and impact of microbiome sciences at Monash and beyond.
